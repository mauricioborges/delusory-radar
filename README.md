Aka Personal organizing tool

## Problem

I have currently too many studies to do, things to improve (mind, body and 
soul :). Also, I've been lost in many different files, tools, mechanisms, 
papers, cards, books and so on, and I have lots of problems to keep focus, 
as well as return to a task after ending. I have lots of things I'd like 
to study, but it seems like I cannot do a pragmatic stuff. 

### Keep in mind that:

* by productivity I wanna mean: "the sensation of accomplishment and good 
feeling of doing something that I want until the end". I'm not doing it 
necessarily relating to any work or academic issue, it's a life necessity
* there's no end
* all sugestions are awesome

## Idea

A tool like a radar or path, related to objectives. For example:
I would like to be more involved in open source community. For that I'd
create a path with some steps to go through it. The path construction can 
generate a few different insights, new paths and problems...that's why a 
radar: a radar isn't linear, and have diffent measurements to check the 
current possition related to the target

## Plan

1. refine the domain
2. do some spec by example
3. code something
4. redo the plan

## Personal fact: 

In fact, I was diagnosed with ADHD a couple times, and it makes me more 
frustrated about the lack of focus and productivity, which can lead me to
depression and so on.
